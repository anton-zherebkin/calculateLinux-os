## System Call Implementation

The document provides an overview of system calls in Calculate Linux, a Gentoo-based distribution, with a specific focus on the setgid() system call.
This function is responsible for changing the group ID (GID) of a process, directly impacting group permissions for file access and resource management.
The document includes a C code snippet demonstrating the use of setgid(), illustrating both successful execution and error handling. Additionally, since Calculate Linux operates on the standard Linux kernel, the behavior of setgid() remains consistent with other Linux systems.
Overall, the document serves as a technical reference for understanding and implementing setgid() in a Linux environment.
